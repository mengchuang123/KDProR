# [ECCV 2024] KDProR: A Knowledge-Decoupling Probabilistic Framework for Video-Text Retrieval

## Overview
The implementation of **KDProR: A Knowledge-Decoupling Probabilistic Framework for Video-Text Retrieval**.

> KDProR explores a novel knowledge-decoupling VTR paradigm that utilizes multi-grained knowledge stores to unify closed- and open-world knowledge.
This strategy, with our principled EKM algorithm, allows VTR models to achieve an efficient balance between memorization and retrieval optimization, while also opening up a unified interface for injecting various open-world knowledge.
Our model achieves SOTA results on MSR-VTT, LSMDC, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo under both close-set and open-set settings.
